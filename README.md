Scripts for models
- `project2_dataprocessing_knn_ann.ipynb ` contains the code to visualize the features, split the dataset into multiclass and binary subsets, implementation for KNN and ANN (pre and post dimension reduction), and model comparison visualizations (pre and post dimension reduction).
- `binary_cv.py`: loads binary_train.csv, runs cross-validation to evaluate Decision Tree models across several max_depth values and Random Forests across several n_estimators, prints CV accuracies and reports best hyperparameters.
- `binary_pca_dt_rf.py`: applies PCA to reduce features of a binary dataset (from binary_train.csv and binary_validation.csv), performs cross-validation to evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest across several hyperparameters, saves CV plots and PCA-reduced CSVs, trains final models with the best hyperparameters, evaluates them on the validation set, and writes summary CSVs
- `binary_train_test.py`: loads binary training and validation CSVs, trains Decision Tree and Random Forest models with preset best hyperparameters, measures training/prediction time, computes accuracy, classification reports and prints a formatted comparison summary for reporting.
- `mc_pca_dt_rf.py`: applies PCA to a multiclass diabetes dataset (multiclass_train.csv / multiclass_validation.csv), runs cross-validation to evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers over different hyperparameters, saves CV plots, trains final models on the PCA-reduced features using the best hyperparameters, evaluates on the validation set, and prints a summary of timing and accuracy.
- `train_final_models.py`: loads multiclass training and validation CSVs, trains Decision Tree and Random Forest models with chosen best hyperparameters, measures training/prediction time, computes accuracies, classification reports and prints a formatted comparison summary.
- `svm_nb.py `: loads both multiclass training and validation CSVS, trains SVM and Naives Bayes models with different hyperparameters (var_smoothing for NB & Kernel for SVMs) testing different hyperparameter values and showing the results of each models best performing hyperparameter, measures both training/prediction time, creates PCA dataset for both multiclass and binary as a csv, computes CV & accuracies, and creates a folder (called plots) and two sub folders (called binary and multiclass respectively) with all the plotted results of runtimes, performances, and comparisons for reporting.
